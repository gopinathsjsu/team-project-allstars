<h1> CMPE 202 - Team project - Team AllStars </h1>
<h1> Flight Application - Booking and Management System (Web application)</h1>
<p> A fully responsive and interactive flight booking and management system developed using <b>MERN </b>stack, i.e. MongoDB,
Express, Reack and Node. The application development was done by following the <b>Agile methodology</b> and <b> XP Core values </b>. 
The emphasis was on all values that enable team work and collaboration like Communication, Simplicity, Respect, Courage and Feedback. 
Functionalities were developed and tracked during each Sprint using Scrum task sheets, Burndown chart, Project task board and Project Journal.

<li> Employee - Admin </li>

<h2> Design Decisions </h2>
<p> For the purpose of Simplicity we decided to go with one-way trip booking for only domestic flights. No connecting flights are added. 
The Mileage points will be calculated based on 25% of the original price at the time of booking. Passenger can either book the flight for them 
or for someone else too. To implement this we get traveller information from the user when proceeding to book the flight. Once a particular flight is 
selected for booking, user can either pay with or without Mileage points. Mileage points will be updated accordingly corresponding to the reservation status. 
Also, the Airline Employee will be able to add a flight, update flight details, cancel flight and view all flights.
In addition to this, other functionalities including the above are mentioned in the upcoming section.
